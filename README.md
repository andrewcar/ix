# We Are IX.
And these are the innards of [our little website](http://www.weareix.com).

# What is IX?
IX (pronounced “nine”) is a NYC metalcore band dedicated to integrating melodic poetry with the most heinous savagery. Harmonic jazz concepts and ferocious breakdowns collide to illuminate the depths of human suffering and the grace that blossoms from darkness.
